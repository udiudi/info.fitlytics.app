# Planning Your Workouts
With Fitlytics you can plan ahead what you're going to do each day of the week.<br />
To simplify planning, but also make it as specified as possible, we offer several abilities.

## Specific Exercise
For each day, you can always add exercises individually. Each exercise has its own configurations which you can edit.

## Routines
A routine is a set of exercises, you can defined how many reps and sets you want to do and what is the frequency of this routine.<br />
A routine can then be added from the calendar using the planning dialog. Once you do that, you'll be able to edit individual exercises for better adjustment to your needs, they each behave as an individual exercise that is planned for that day.

## Daily Focus
Daily Focus is the most simplest form of planning. If you want to specify rest days, deload period, even if plan to jog or do some flexibility drills: you can mark it as a daily event in your calendar without specifying anything else.<br />
**Tip:** If you use "DELOAD" as a daily focus, it'll be colored differently than any other planned event.
