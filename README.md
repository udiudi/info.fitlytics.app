## What's New
### March 5th, 2021
- Merged a few exercises that had an accessory in their name. Entries of "Dips: Parallel Bars" became an entry of exercise "Dips" with the accessory set to "Parallel Bars".<br />Same has been done with exercises with dumbells, barbells and rings.

- Not showing additional weight if it's 0kg :)

### March 3rd, 2021
- Added "Accessories" to entries. You can mark what did you use to perform a certain exercise (Rings, parallel bars, pull-up bar, barbell and etc.).<br />Accessories are available for workout entries and workouts you plan to do.
